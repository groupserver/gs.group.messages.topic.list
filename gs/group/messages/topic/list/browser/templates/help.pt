  <h3>Topics Tab</h3>
  <p>
    The <cite class="tab">Topics</cite> tab shows what people have be 
    discussing in a group.
    By default the tab shows the topics that people have posted to 
    recently, with the most recent topic first.
    For each topic the following information is provided.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>The name of the topic.</dd>

    <dt>Files</dt>
    <dd>The icons representing each file that has been posted to the 
    topic, if any, will appear after the name.</dd>

    <dt>Keywords</dt>
    <dd>Words that appear frequently in the topic, but infrequently
      in other topics.</dd>

    <dt>Number of posts</dt>
    <dd>The number of posts in the topic.</dd>

    <dt>Most recent author</dt>
    <dd>The name of the person who most recently posted to the 
      topic.</dd>

    <dt>Date of the most recent post</dt>
    <dd>The date that the most recent post was made.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The topics will generally be ordered from the topic with the most
    recent post, to the topic with the oldest post.
    However, the site administrator may decide that some topics are
    very important and make them
    <em class="wordasword">sticky</em>.
    These sticky topics will be shown before the other topics, and
    will be marked with a pin-icon to the left of the topic-name.
